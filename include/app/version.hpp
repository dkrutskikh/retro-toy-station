  \struct Version
  \brief Application version information structure.

  Version represents a semantic version number following the major.minor.maintenance.revision format. This structure is
  designed for compile-time version management and provides a simple way to track application versions throughout the
  development lifecycle.

  \section features Key Features

  - ⚙️ **Semantic Versioning**: Follows major.minor.maintenance.revision format
  - 🔧 **ConstExpr Support**: All operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - 🛡️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - 🔗 **Simple Structure**: Plain struct with public members for easy access
  - 🎯 **Version Management**: Designed for application version tracking
  - 🧬 **Type Safety**: Uses uint32_t for all version components
  - 🌍 **Standard Compliance**: Follows semantic versioning standards
  - 📏 **Immutable Design**: Structure designed for compile-time version constants

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "app.hpp"

  // Default version (0.0.0.0)
  constexpr toy::app::Version version;

  // Custom version
  constexpr toy::app::Version customVersion{1, 2, 3, 4};

  // Access version components
  std::cout << "Version: " << customVersion.major << "."
            << customVersion.minor << "."
            << customVersion.maintenance << "."
            << customVersion.revision << std::endl;
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ⚙️ **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - 📝 **Access**: O(1) constant time for all members
  - 📝 **Assignment**: O(1) constant time for member assignment
  - 🔗 **Comparison**: O(1) constant time for version comparison
  - 💾 **Memory Usage**: 16 bytes (4 * uint32_t)
  - ⚡ **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to small size and contiguous layout
  - 📋 **Copy Performance**: Fast due to simple integer copying
  - 🎯 **Version Operations**: Optimized for compile-time evaluation

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - 🛡️ **Bounds Safety**: All operations are bounds-safe
  - 📐 **Type Safety**: Strong typing with uint32_t components
  - ⚠️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown
  - 🔒 **Memory Safety**: No dynamic allocation, stack-only structure

  \section compatibility Compatibility

  - 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms supported by the compiler
  - 🔧 **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
  - 📱 **Mobile Platforms**: Lightweight and efficient for mobile applications

  \note This structure is designed for compile-time version management.
  \note For runtime version parsing from strings, consider implementing additional utility functions.

  \brief Equality operator for two versions.

  Compares two versions for exact equality of all components.

  \note This performs exact equality comparison. For semantic versioning compatibility, consider using the three-way

  \brief Three-way comparison operator for two versions.

  Compares two versions using lexicographical ordering following semantic versioning principles. The comparison

  \param rhs The right-hand side version.
