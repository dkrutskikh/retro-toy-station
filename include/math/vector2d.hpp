  \class Vector2D
  \brief 2D floating-point vector class for interactive game objects and physics calculations.

  Vector2D represents a 2D vector with floating-point coordinates, designed for interactive game objects, sprite
  positioning, character movement, particle systems, physics calculations, and world coordinate transformations where
  sub-pixel precision is required.

  \section features Key Features

  - ⚙️ **Floating-Point Precision**: Uses \a real_t (float) for sub-pixel positioning and smooth movement
  - 🔧 **ConstExpr Support**: Most operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - 🛡️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - 🎯 **Game Optimized**: Designed specifically for interactive game objects and physics
  - 🧬 **Type Safety**: Strong typing with clear vector semantics

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "math/vector2d.hpp"

  // Sprite positioning
  toy::math::Vector2D spritePos(100.5f, 200.3f);

  // Character movement
  toy::math::Vector2D velocity(50.0f, -25.0f);
  spritePos += velocity * deltaTime;

  // Physics calculations
  toy::math::Vector2D force(10.0f, 0.0f);
  toy::math::Vector2D acceleration = force / mass;

  // Particle system
  std::vector<toy::math::Vector2D> particles;
  for (auto& particle : particles) {
      particle += velocity * deltaTime;
  }
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ⚙️ **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - 📝 **Assignment**: O(1) constant time
  - 🔗 **Arithmetic Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - ⚖️ **Comparison Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - 💾 **Memory Usage**: 8 bytes (2 * sizeof(real_t))
  - ⚡ **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to small size and stack allocation
  - 📋 **Copy Performance**: Fast due to simple floating-point copying

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - 🛡️ **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Division by zero is asserted in debug
  - 🔒 **Bounds Safety**: All operations are bounds-safe
  - 📐 **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents coordinate mixing
  - ⚠️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown

  \note This class is specifically designed for interactive game objects and physics calculations.
  \note For UI positioning and pixel-perfect coordinates, consider using Point with integer coordinates.
