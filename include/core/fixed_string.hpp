  \class FixedString
  \brief Template string class with fixed-size character buffer.

  FixedString is a lightweight, high-performance string class that uses a fixed-size character buffer allocated on the
  stack. It provides a std::string-like interface while avoiding dynamic memory allocation, making it suitable for
  embedded systems, real-time applications, and performance-critical code where memory allocation overhead must be
  minimized.

  \tparam allocatedSize The size of the internal character buffer, including space for the null terminator.
                        Must be greater than zero.

  \section features Key Features

  - ⚙️ **Zero Dynamic Allocation**: All memory is allocated on the stack at compile time
  - 🔧 **ConstExpr Support**: Most operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - 🛡️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - 🔗 **STL Compatibility**: Provides std::string-like interface
  - 🌍 **UTF-8 Support**: Built-in UTF-8 character counting and manipulation
  - 🧬 **Type Safety**: Uses C++20 concepts for type safety

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "fixed_string.hpp"

  // Create a string with 32-character capacity
  toy::FixedString<32> str("Hello, World!");

  // Append more content
  str += " This is a test.";

  // Use in constexpr context
  constexpr auto greeting = toy::FixedString<16>("Hello");
  constexpr auto world = toy::FixedString<16>("World");
  constexpr auto combined = greeting + " " + world;
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ⚙️ **Construction**: O(n) where n is the length of the source string
  - 📝 **Assignment**: O(n) where n is the length of the source string
  - 🔗 **Concatenation**: O(n) where n is the length of the appended string
  - 🔍 **Search Operations**: O(n*m) where n is the string length and m is the pattern length
  - ⚖️ **Comparison Operations**: O(n) where n is the string length
  - 💾 **Memory Usage**: Fixed at compile time, no heap allocation
  - ⚡ **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to stack allocation and contiguous memory layout
  - 📋 **Copy Performance**: Fast due to memcpy/memmove optimizations
  - 🎯 **String Operations**: Optimized for common cases

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - 🛡️ **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Bounds/capacity are asserted in debug; in production, violating preconditions is UB
  - 🔒 **Null Pointer Safety**: All C-string operations validate pointers via assertions in debug
  - 📐 **Type Safety**: Template parameters and concepts prevent invalid usage
  - ⚠️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown

  \section compatibility Compatibility

  - 🆕 **C++23**: Requires C++23 or later for full functionality
  - 🔗 **STL Integration**: Compatible with STL algorithms and containers
  - 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms supported by the compiler
  - 🔧 **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments

  \note The internal buffer size is allocatedSize, but the maximum string length is allocatedSize - 1 (null terminator).
