    \brief Removes all elements from the vector.

    This method destroys all elements currently stored in the vector and sets the size to zero. The vector can be reused
    after clearing.

    \post The vector is empty (size is \c 0).
    \post All elements are properly destroyed.

    \note This method properly destroys each element (destructor calls are optimized away for trivially destructible
    types).
    \note After calling \a clear(), the vector can be reused without reallocation.
    \note For POD types, this operation is very fast.
    \note The internal buffer is not deallocated, only elements are destroyed.
