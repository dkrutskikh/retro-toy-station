  \class CallbacksPool
  \brief Template callback pool class with fixed-size callback storage.

  CallbacksPool is a lightweight, high-performance callback pool class that uses a fixed-size array to store function
  pointers. It provides a simple observer pattern implementation without dynamic memory allocation, making it suitable
  for embedded systems, real-time applications, and performance-critical code where memory allocation overhead must be
  minimized.

  \tparam type          The type of the callback parameter. Must be a copyable type.
  \tparam allocatedSize The maximum number of callbacks that can be stored in the pool. Must be greater than zero
                        (default: \c 4).

  \section features Key Features

  - ⚙️ **Zero Dynamic Allocation**: All memory is allocated on the stack at compile time
  - 🔧 **ConstExpr Support**: All operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - 🛡️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - 🔗 **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use callback subscription and invocation
  - 🧬 **Type Safety**: Strong typing with template parameters

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "core/callbacks_pool.hpp"

  // Define callback function
  void onEvent(int value) {
    // Handle event
  }

  // Create a callback pool with default size (4 callbacks)
  toy::CallbacksPool<int> pool;

  // Subscribe to events
  pool.add(onEvent);

  // Invoke all registered callbacks
  pool.call(42);

  // Check subscriber count
  auto count = pool.subscribersAmount();

  // Unsubscribe
  pool.remove(onEvent);

  // Clear all subscriptions
  pool.reset();
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ⚙️ **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - 📝 **Adding Callback**: O(n) where n is the number of registered callbacks (for duplicate check)
  - 🔗 **Removing Callback**: O(n) where n is the number of registered callbacks
  - 🔍 **Calling Callbacks**: O(n) where n is the number of registered callbacks
  - 📊 **Subscriber Count**: O(1) constant time (cached count)
  - 💾 **Memory Usage**: Fixed at compile time
  - ⚡ **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to stack allocation and contiguous memory layout
  - 📋 **Copy Performance**: Fast due to array-based storage

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - 🛡️ **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Null pointer checks are asserted in debug; in release, violating preconditions is UB
  - 🔒 **Bounds Safety**: Pool capacity is fixed at compile time; adding beyond capacity is asserted in debug
  - 📐 **Type Safety**: Template parameters ensure type-safe callback invocation
  - ⚠️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown

  \note The pool does not prevent duplicate subscriptions - adding the same callback multiple times will only register
        it once and return \c true.
  \note When the pool is full, attempts to add new callbacks will fail (asserted in debug mode).

  \warning Callbacks must remain valid for the lifetime of the CallbacksPool object. The pool does not manage callback
           lifetime.
