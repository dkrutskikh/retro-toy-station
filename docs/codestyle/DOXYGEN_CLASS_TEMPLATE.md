# Doxygen Documentation Template for Classes

This file contains templates for generating Doxygen documentation for classes in the ToyGine2 project. Use these templates as a reference when creating new documentation.

## General Rules

1. All sections should start with an emoji and **bold text** for the element name
2. Code examples should be practical and clear
3. Performance characteristics should be specified using Big-O notation
4. Safety guarantees should be described specifically and accurately
5. The `compatibility` section is only added for classes with special requirements
